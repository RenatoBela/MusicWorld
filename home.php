	<p>Zagreb, Croatia - Music World started operating on October 28th 2023. It started as a couple of posts on a personal blog but quickly grew.</p>
        <p>The owners of the site are music enthusiasts. They love Rock, Metal, New Wave and indie music.</p>
        <p>Music World became the fastest growing news site soon after the owners finished college and became a full time developers.</p>
